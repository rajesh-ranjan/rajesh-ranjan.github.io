I am a post-doctoral researcher at the **Dept. of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, The Ohio State University**. My research interests include study of transitional and turbulent flows. Some key areas are:

Flow Instability 
======
My primary interest is to use stability analysis tools for understanding of complex flows. The analyses include global stability analysis, adjoint analysis, resolvent and input-output analysis. Since most of these tools require a very large eigenvalue problem to be solved, they are often not employed for practical problems, where the degrees of freedom may be prohibitively high. Thus, I have developed matrix-free 'Mean Flow Perturbation' (MFP) technique which can be used for complex configurations. In this, the linearization of the flow is directly performed within the Navier-Stokes code, and the eigenvalue problem is solved in an alternate way to extract only relevant modes. For high-dimensional problems, I also use ARPACK and SLEPc libraries to extract accurate eigenvalues from a Krylov Subspace.
